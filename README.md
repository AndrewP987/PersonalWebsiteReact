This website is built using React and incorporates various public libraries, such as React Bootstrap, React Helmet, React Icons, and npm packages. The application features reusable React UI components, an assets folder for images and my resume, a components folder for housing UI components, and a data folder to store JSON objects for populating the UI components.

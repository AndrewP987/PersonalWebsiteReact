            "Sudoku is a very popular game that has been around for decades. For some people, the game is very hard to play. For that reason, and well practice reasons, I have created this sudoku solver app. In the sudokuProblems directory, there are already 2 puzzles that you can look at and maybe solve on your own before using the app to do so for you. To add another puzzle, just make another .txt file and copy the format of the other puzzles. This app uses Backtracking, Java, and Interfaces. In the Computer Science world, Backtracking is a technique that is used to solve problems recursively by trying to build a solution. It implments a strategy called pruning in order to quickly discard invalid configurations that were made when making new successors to such configuration.",

            "MazePathFinder is a maze game, but the playing is done by an algorithm. The algorithm is Breadth First Search or BFS. In the application, a user is given a maze and enters two coordinates of the maze, a start and end coordinate. The two coordinates are then passed to the BFS solver, which finds the shortest path from the start to end. BFS always guarantees the shortest path as long as one exists. Each coordinate in the graph is considered a node and with each node are neighbors. Before BFS can run, a node direct adjacency list is made and printed for the user as well as the graph for user visual.",

        description:
            "Jam Game is a popular board game amongst younger children. In light of this, I decided to create a GUI version of the game using Java and JavaFX to create UI design. The point of the game is to move the RED X labeled car all the way to the right side of the board, but there are other cars in the way preventing such a thing. In order to get the red car to the side of the board, the player must implement problem solving to move the other cars either horizontally or vertically based on the way they are facing. In the program, Breadth First Search is constantly being used to find the next shortest game layer to get to a solution. So if the game player is stuck and doesn't know what move to make, he/she can press the 'Hint' button which will update the game by moving a car based on the configuration created from the BFS algorithm. If the puzzle at the current configuration or game board is not solvable, then the user is notified. Back to cars, cars either move horizontally or vetically and they cannot jump over other cars in their way to the second selected spot by the user. If the user tries to break these rules, they will not be able to complete them and will be notified. In the game another important concept besides Breadth First Search and configuration making, is using the concept of MVC or Model View Controller. Whenever a car was pressed or a load button was clicked, the controller called the model to run the specific function to take care of that action. In doing so the view was then updated for the user interface. For example, if the user wants to change the game puzzle, they would press the load button, in which the controller would notify the model to execute the load function for the user's new puzzle choice. If the puzzle is valid, than the view is updated by displaying the new puzzle.",
